# Introduction
This repository contains R scripts that organize, clean, harmonize, analyze, and plot data from a synthesis working group between three Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites: Cedar Creek (CDR), Kellogg Biological Station (KBS), and Konza Prairie (KNZ). We looked at how the resistance and resilience of aboveground biomass to extreme climate events and anthropogenic drivers are shaped by multiple properties of plant community structure, including species richness, evenness, and dominant species.

# Workflow
## L1 Folder

Each LTER site has its own R script for initial merging of datasets across that site that fit our criteria and cleaning. There is a script that pulls in SPEI 3, 6, 9, and 12, for each site and combines them into one file. Following these, there is a script to combine all the sites' data into one file and another script that combines all the sites' data with the SPEI data into one file.

## L2 Folder
There is a script to calculate dominance and diversity (richness and evenness) and another to calculate resistance and resilience. For each analysis we carried out, there is a separate script (e.g. analyses_LMM_L2.R, analyses_sem_L2.R).

# Location of data
Some L1 data and all L2 data that are processed in the scripts in this repository are published as an EDI package (URL HERE). In some scripts, the header may state that the data was input from Google Drive, which is an artifact of our data processing steps.

# Spatiotemporal extent and resolution
Spatial extent: Three Long-Term Ecological Sites (LTER): Cedar Creek (East Bethel, Minnesota, USA; 45° 24' 3.6" N, 93° 12' 3.599" W), Kellogg Biological Station (Hickory Corners, Michigan, USA; 42° 23' 60" N, 85° 24' 0" W), Konza Prairie (Manhattan, Kansas, USA; 39° 5' 34.8" N, 96° 34' 30" W).
Temporal extent: 1982-2023
We compiled data that contained at least five consecutive years of plant aboveground biomass and community composition data from the three LTER sites mentioned above.

# Usage
All analyses were conducted using R (R Core Team 2021).

# File naming conventions
### Scripts are organized into two folders: L1 and L2.

•	L1 scripts clean and harmonize raw site-level data, then combine them into standardized datasets. Script names indicate the site or step in the wrangling process (e.g., CDR_initial_data_wrangling_L1.R, all_sites_dataset_plus_spei_L1.R).

•	L2 scripts use the cleaned and merged data to calculate ecological metrics (diversity, dominance, resistance, resilience), run analyses (LMM, SEM), and produce summary tables or figures. These are named for the calculation or analysis they perform (e.g., dominance_diversity_calculations_L2.R, analyses_LMM_L2.R).

### Data files are organized into two folders: L1 and L2.

•	L1 holds cleaned, site-level and combined datasets, named for their contents (e.g., species_abundance_L1.csv, site_years_with_SPEI.csv).

•	L2 holds analysis outputs, named after the metric or model (e.g., plot_metrics_SPEI_diversity_L2.csv, ece_resist_resil_spei9_norm_L2.csv).
